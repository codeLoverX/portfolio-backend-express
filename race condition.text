I mistakenly also thought you couldn't get race conditions in Node.js because it's single threaded nature, 
but as soon as you use a shared resource outside of node (e.g. a file from the file system) you can get into 
a race condition. I posted an example of this issue in this question when I was 
trying to understand this: node.js readfile woes.
